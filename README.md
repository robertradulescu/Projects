# Projects
These are some projects I did during college.
One of them is a questionnaire website, where users can make questionnaires and receive feedback on whether the answer is correct or not. The admin also has the ability to add new questions.

The second project is an unfinished online chess game. Users can move the pawns on the game board, they can see the position of the enemy pawn in the form of a matrix.
